 *
 * Establishing a securesession is an involved process, involving
 * communicating between the reader and the application, communication
 * between the application and the server, and communication between the
 * reader and the server, using the application as a proxy as the reader lacks
 * network capability. While securesession secures communication between the
 * reader and the server, as it goes through the application, the application
 * itself must secure itself in order to be allowed to act as the proxy for
 * communication. That process is done by a library called Minesweeper that
 * is built into the application, and the process itself is called Device
 * Attestation. Establishing a securesession itself, when the application is
 * already secure, takes an overage < 1 second. However, if the application
 * is not secure when an attempt is made, then securesession establishment
 * will be blocked waiting for the application to secure itself, which can
 * take between 10-20 seconds on average, or even more than 30 seconds
 * depending on the device the application is running on, and the stability
 * and speed of the network connection.
